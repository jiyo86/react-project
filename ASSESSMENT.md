## Set up the react app and make it working

This is a simple react project connecting to MongoDB database to retrive existing users 
and add new user to the system.
If user name is already existing don't allow to create again


## Steps to follow
1. Clone this repo in your system
2. Install all dependency and make the project working in your system
3. Review the code and provide your feedback for the improvements

# Assessment
1. Fix all errors and ensure the project is working as expected
2. Allow creation of a new user only if the username does not already exist in the system. Display an error message if the user name is already in use.
3. Show successful message for valid data creation and redirect to user list.
4. Create a github action workflow to build and release the package to docker container while merge to main branch from the feature branch.
